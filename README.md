# Sancho: The Matthew's La Mancha Land bot
A silly little bot for a silly little server, written in DiscordGo.

Current capabilities include:
- Surprisingly flexible reminders!
- Rolling dice (now with support for multiple modifiers)
- Boundary of Death
- Jpeg command and its evil brother, Yesod command
- Sanchoball, a tool worthy of being used by even the most powerful of Bloodfiend diviners
- Lament, Mourn and Despair
- Some other miscellaneous commands
