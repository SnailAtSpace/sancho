# Sancho: The Matthew's La Mancha Land bot
A silly little bot for a silly little server, written in DiscordGo.

Current capabilities include:
- Reminders!
- Rolling dice (now with support for multiple modifiers!)
- Boundary of Death
- Jpeg command and its evil brother, Yesod command
- Some other miscellaneous commands
