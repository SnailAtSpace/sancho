It is OK, Ender. We are not mad.
Your actions have consequences — ones that we are fully able to take on. Most likely. Your apology is appreciated, but unneeded.
You have committed no crime, Ender — certainly not a transgression worthy of such an apology.
Hold your tongue — You have committed no wrongdoing.
...None of us here take pleasure in seeing you feel such remorse. Not me, not anybody else.
We forgive you, fret not.
