Quoth her: "ender u gongoozler it's okay". 
Ender, we will mail you a maid dress and cat ears and put the package in your full government name.
IT'S **OKAY** ENDER, WE AREN'T MAD!
Whoops has told me to not be too harsh on you, but...
Your actions have consequences — ones that we are fully able to take on. Most likely. Your apology is appreciated, but unneeded.
You have committed no crime, Ender — certainly not a transgression worthy of such an apology.
You are not my ... foolish Father. Your apology is unneeded.
Speak not out of place. Consider yourself forgiven; there are more important matters to attend to.
Every time you apologise, you take a century off my lifespan.
Hold your tongue — You have committed no wrongdoing.
Your hasty, instinctual responses remind me too much of those Fixers that Father continues to spin outlandish tales of.
How utterly futile. Your apologies carry you nowhere — much like the horses on a merry-go-round.
If only blood ran our throats as often apologies ran yours.
Is this some sort of Hardblood Art you are practicing? Such repetition would only make sense in such a context.
The sanguine lance is looking a little bit too clean tonight...
...None of us here take pleasure in seeing you feel such remorse. Not me, not anybody else.
